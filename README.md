# Representations

An upcoming book, by Alex &amp; Aaron


## Part 0: Old Notions & New Horizons

### 1) Old Notions Revisited

First draft completed, need to draw up figures. dwabi

### 2) New Horizons Developed

Close to being done. 

  Aaron:
  
    Fill up the gaps in the Topology section 2.3
    Stereographic projection of sphere as an example of coordinate charts/atlasses 
    Writing up the Embeddings vs. Intrinsic Geometry section 2.4
  Alex:

    Adopting Aaron's work for scalar/vector fields into section 2.5 

## Part 1: A Better Language

### 3) Differential Geometry

Most of the material is written up. Need to explain differential forms more intuitively.
  Alex: 

    Intuitive explaination of Differential forms. Finish Stokes' theorem 


### 4) Beyond Harmonics: Representation Theory

  Alex: 

    May want to split this up into two chapters: Fourier Analysis first and Rep Theory second.

## Part 2: Physics

### 5) Symmetries of the Sphere: SU(2) and Friends

  Alex:
  
    Dwabi, we'll get to it before august finishes

### 6) Classical Mechanics and Sympletic Geometry

  Aaron: 

    Read up on Legendre Transform, do we want it?
    Feynman Argument for conservation in the Lagrangian viewpoint
    Yo facetime with me about Symplectic geometry.. 
      I have a good idea about intuition behind how the symplectic form bundles everything together and lets us go from a hamiltonian to \partial / \partial t -> the arrow of time -> 
    

### 7) Einstein's Gravity
  Aaron:
    Here be Covariant Derivatives? 

## Part 3: More Advanced Topics

### 8) An Introduction to Geometric Quantization

### 9) Classification of Simple Lie Algebras over C
