# Representations

####An upcoming book, by Alex &amp; Aaron



## Prerequisites

### 1) Old Notions Revisited

First draft completed, need to draw up figures. dwabi
OK there's a problem with a^i vs v^i vs \mathbf v_i_ (vs possible e_i_) usage in this chapter. I SHOULD BE USING X^i instead of v^i for vector fields :'( Let's fix that though.


### 2) New Horizons

Close to being done. 

  Aaron:
  
    Fill up the gaps in the Topology section 2.3
    Stereographic projection of sphere as an example of coordinate charts/atlasses 
    Writing up the Embeddings vs. Intrinsic Geometry section 2.4
  Alex:
	OK SOMEWHERE we need to define:
		Commutative diagrams, Dual Spaces and functionals
    Adopting Aaron's work for scalar/vector fields into section 2.5 

## Part 1: A Better Language

### 3) Differential Geometry

THINGS WE SHOULD HAVE DEFINED EARLIER ON:
	C^\infty(M), tangent BUNDLES, cotangent BUNDLES\
	That 1/k! on the k-form coefficient tensor

Most of the material is written up. Need to explain differential forms more intuitively.

  Either of us:
	Finish Stokes' theorem proof.. idk find a good reference, all the groundwork is there
	
	

  Alex: 
    Finish some Lie derivative summaries

  Aaron:  
    Do we want another section on connections here or in GR? 


### 4) Harmonics: Fourier Analysis

   Alex:
	Start with the discretized unit interval and take the limit, DFT -> Fourier Series
	Then generalize to the real line
		-> Fourier transform is a change of basis... 
	Now go to spectral graph theory 
		-> 
	And return to the plane, solving the wave equation/heat equation
		convolutions.. roast Aaron here
	

### 5) Beyond Harmonics: Representation Theory
 
  We begin assuming knowledge of group theory/ intro-level abstract algebra. 
  	Look at finite groups...
		Build analogous results to fourier analysis
	Return to graphs 
		graphs -> quivers?
		Representation theory of k[x] = Jordan Normal Form
	
	Some statements about compact groups/topological groups?


## Part 2: Physics

### 6) SL(2,C), SU(2), SL(2,R).. all of finite dimensional QM basically

  Review how this ties together: rep theory of SO(3) leading to SO(3,1), and spinors (projective representations)

  Aaron:
	Dude put a QI section here, that would be excellent

### 7) Classical Mechanics and Sympletic Geometry

  Aaron: 

    Read up on Legendre Transform, do we want it?
    Feynman Argument for conservation in the Lagrangian viewpoint
    Symplectic geometry: 
      I have a good idea about intuition behind how the symplectic form bundles everything together and lets us go from a hamiltonian to \partial / \partial t -> the arrow of time -> 
    

### 8) Einstein's Gravity
  Aaron:

    Here be Covariant Derivatives. Motivate Riemann Curvature
	
	READ WEYLS BOOK it literally derives GR from LOGIC 
	
	And then:
	
	Black holes, let them spin let them be charged. Let there be parallel universe, everything. 
	Penrose diagrams
	
	Expanding universes, redshift, Hubble's thing.. ADM might be too much its ugly af imo (but the preceeding chapter HAS developed the hamiltonian formalism enough)
	
	The cosmological constant: stroke of genius or just a stupid freaking Lambda that Einstein put in.  

## Part 3: More Advanced Topics

### 9) An Introduction to Geometric Quantization

   The idea should be that even though, physically, we can barely grasp quantization at first glance, the mathematics guides us and we shuold try to interpret THAT physically. 

### 10) Classification of Simple Lie Algebras over C
   Alex:
	I got this... You Qi's notes will be the guide
