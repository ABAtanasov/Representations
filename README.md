# Representations

An upcoming book, by Alex &amp; Aaron


## Part 0: Old Notions & New Horizons

### 1) Old Notions Revisited

First draft completed, need to draw up figures. 

### 2) New Horizons Developed

Currently being written up, adopting Aaron's material from the old Diff Geo chapter into here. 

## Part 1: A Better Language

### 3) Differential Geometry

Most of the material is written up. Need to explain differential forms more intuitively.

### 4) Beyond Harmonics: Representation Theory

May want to split this up into two chapters: Fourier Analysis first and Rep Theory second.

## Part 2: Physics

### 5) Symmetries of the Sphere: SU(2) and Friends

### 6) Classical Mechanics and Sympletic Geometry

### 7) Einstein's Gravity

## Part 3: More Advanced Topics

### 8) An Introduction to Geometric Quantization

### 9) Classification of Simple Lie Algebras over C
