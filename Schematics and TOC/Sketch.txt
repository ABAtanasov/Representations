Chapter 0: Philosophy
	Before we get into a lot of the topics of vectors/forms, let's motivate why we care, what a coordinate system means and why it's important. 
	
Chapter 1: Vectors, Forms, Metrics, etc.
	We're going to start with Stokes' theorem, because that's immediately recognized by a general informed audience of undergraduates as very beautifully stated in the language of forms
	Then we're going to talk about the Lie Derivative and use it to motivate the study of Lie algebras
	We'll talk about the metric, killing fields, and covariant derivatives. This will be applied in the relativity section
	
Chapter 2: Rep Theory of Groups
	
Chapter 3: Rep Theory of sl_2 (su_2 )
	The mother of all lie algebras
	Spin n/2, clebsch gordan, 6-j, etc
	

Chapter 4: Lie theory, in Full
	Classification of complex simple lie algebras 
	Their representations (generalizing sl_2)
	
	
Further material to cover:
	Applications: GR, Molecular spectra, the standard model
