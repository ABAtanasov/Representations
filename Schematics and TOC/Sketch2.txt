What is our audience? 
	-> Undergraduate students that are good enough in physics that they would appreciate this book, but haven't had the opportunity to take the 'next step'.. so while they know basic quantum/lagrangian mechanics, they've never seen modern treatments of manifolds, GR, etc, and they've also not dealt with representation theory. 
	Let's give a new perspective to these crazy cripples. 

In fact, certain sections should require less knowledge than others, 
	Like I want basically anyone who's taken multi and understands it to be able to read part 1 on diff geo/stokes' thorem
	And similarly, anyone with linear algebra knowledge should understand the rep theory.

Diff Geo: 
	Manifolds, Fields on Manifolds
	Stokes' Theorem (Drops mic)
	Lie Derivative, Lie algebra, Killing fields
	Metric, Connection induced by a metric
		Tensors and coordinate independent physical laws
		What is a connection physically?
	
Representation Theory:
	On the real line (Fourier transform)
	On a finite structure, like a group
		Irreps, character theory
		Applications to spectroscopy
	On a continuous group
		Induced representations?
	On a homogenous space
		Spherical Harmonics, etc
	
The Lie algebra sl_2:
	Derivation
	Spin, Clebcsh-Gordan
		An exercise on Mckay's correspondence
		Spinning the diagrams around by tensoring
	sl_2(R) and the upper half plane? 
	
Classical mechanics, towards Symplectic:
	Hamiltonian treatment on phase space:
		A way to go between scalar fields (hamiltonians) and vectors
		
	Lets not mess around.. we assume these readers know Lagrangians
		-> But let's show feynman's argument somewhere in here


General Relativity, towards deriving Einstein's equations like Weyl does:


Classification of Lie Algebras:
	sl_2 is the mother of all Lie algebras, nuff said
	draw some mofockin diagrams

Quantization:
	Geometrically? Idk what else man
	
Maybe just make an appendix for all the abstract nonsense:
	Categories, Bundles, Topology, Homological Cohomology memes etc
