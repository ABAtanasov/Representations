% This will be the book itself, all .tex files compiled into one source. For simplicity, as well as to save space, we're going to have each chapter be a .tex on its own

% Don't forget.. when made into a book odd numbers go on the right, even numbers on the left. This is probably a publisher's issue but it's worth remembering


% When I say "pages" that means two pages = one page front and back
